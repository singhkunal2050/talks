Talk Proposal: Building a Blog Publisher MCP Server with Cursor
Kunal Singh | ClevertapNovember 05, 2025
Overview

I built a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that automates blog publishing directly to GitHub—eliminating context switching and manual deployment. This talk showcases how Cursor's AI-powered development accelerated the entire build process and demonstrates the real-world value of MCP servers for developer productivity.



What I'll Cover



The Problem (2 min)

Context switching kills productivity when managing technical blogs
Manual formatting, commits, and deployment add friction to content creation
Developers avoid blogging because the overhead isn't worth it


The Solution: Blog Publisher MCP (3 min)

Publish blog posts directly from your development environment
Automatic frontmatter generation, file naming, and Git commits
Three core tools: Publish, List, and Update blog posts
Works with Cursor, Claude Desktop, or any MCP-compatible tool


How Cursor Accelerated Development (3 min)

Intelligent code completion with MCP SDK patterns
Context-aware suggestions for GitHub API integration
Rapid debugging and error handling assistance
What took hours traditionally took minutes with Cursor


Live Demo (5 min)

Publishing a new blog post from Cursor
Listing existing posts
Updating content on the fly
Showing the GitHub commits it generates


The Bigger Picture (2 min)

MCP servers bridge AI assistance with real automation
Platform-agnostic: build once, use everywhere
The future of AI-powered development workflows


Key Takeaways

✅ Real productivity gains: 10x faster from idea to published post
✅ Universal compatibility: Works across multiple AI development tools
✅ Practical automation: Move beyond chat to actual workflow integration
✅ Developer-friendly: Built in ~2 hours with Cursor's assistance


Why This Matters for Cursor Users

MCP servers represent the next evolution of AI-powered development—not just code completion, but full workflow automation. This talk shows how Cursor makes building these integrations accessible and demonstrates the tangible value of the MCP ecosystem.



Format

15-minute presentation
Live coding/demo included
Open source code available
Q&A friendly


Target Audience

Developers interested in AI-assisted development, workflow automation, and practical applications of MCP servers. No prior MCP knowledge required!



TL;DR: I built an MCP server with Cursor that publishes blogs directly to GitHub. I'll show how Cursor made it fast to build, demo it live, and discuss why MCP servers are game-changers for developer productivity.
